# AIFourInARow

Simple AI four-in-a-row game (drop chips into a 6 row x 8 col grid). 
Obviously based on a common children's game. 

The point was to experiment and build myself up with Neural Networks. 



# Model






# What I learned 

Probably the thing I solidified the most was why AI has not taken off until now. 
In this case I'm using a 'conventional' algorithm to train a Neural net. That's fine, but 
it also pretty much guarantees the Neural Net won't be smarter than the conventional 
algorithm, and thus it makes more sense for me to use the conventional algorithm. 

The time you'd want a neural net is if you didn't know *how* to code something 
Obviously I knew that conceptually before but this helped reaffirm that in my mind.
